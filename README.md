Restful API with Authentication and Authorization using JWT in Nodejs


It consist of a User model and controller. The model
defines the data, and the controller will contain all 
the business logic needed to interact with the database. 

It has a db file which will be used to
connect the app to the database, and an app file used
for bootstrapping the application itself.

The server file is used to spin up the server and tells the
app to listen on a specific port.
